# Cornershop-Meals
Cornershop meals is a meal management service that provides a very convenient way of meal reservation to Cornershop employees. Allowing admin (Nora) to send slack messages and view all the employee choices.

### Setup
This app is deployed on Heroku https://cornershop-meals-app.herokuapp.com.
Please follow below steps if you would like to setup the project locally.

1. Clone this repository   
    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/jubins/Cornershop-Meals.git
    ```
2. Create a virtual env with Python 3
    ```
    $ virtualenv venv
    $ virtualenv source venv/bin/activate
    ```
3. Install dependences
    ```
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. I am using Postgres database for storing the data, Redis as message broker, Celery for asynchronous slack messaging and Slack webhook. Configure these environment variables in [`corenershopmeals/env.ini`](https://github.com/jubins/Cornershop-Meals/blob/master/cornershopmeals/env.ini).
5. Apply Django migrations
    ```
    $ cd cornershopmeals
    $ python manage.py makemigrations
    $ python manage.py migrate
    ```
6. Start Django server
    ```
    $ python manage.py runserver
    ```
7. Run Celery (in a different terminal window)
    ```
    $ celery -A cornershopmeals worker -l info
    ``` 
   
8. Go to `localhost:8000/signup` to create a food admin employee account that will be the food admin, by checking `is_staff` option and make sure to choose good `username` and `password` otherwise Signup will not occur.
    You can also create a superuser.
    ```
    $ python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

9. Go to `localhost:8000/login` to create some employee accounts and use the app.

10. Slack notifications are sent on a channel. Please configure your slack `WEBHOOK_URL` in [`corenershopmeals/env.ini`](https://github.com/jubins/Cornershop-Meals/blob/master/cornershopmeals/env.ini#L12) to test slack notifications.
